# Bitcoin Guide

*Last Update: August 14, 2020*

This guide is a brief introduction on Bitcoin usage.

For activists who escaped their country or in political exile, to a country where they have little friends and no family, Bitcoin (abbreviated BTC) can be a method for family members abroad to transfer wealth over to the activist in a new foreign land, without going through the banking system.

## Using Bitcoin for daily expenses

While numerous Internet services such as [VPN](https://nordvpn.com) can be paid for using BTC, ideally you will be able to use your Bitcoin for daily expenses. This can be accomplished using a service that gives you a virtual and/or real credit via an anonymous BTC account. Here is a [list](http://www.bestbitcoincard.com/anonymous/) of such services. Some services like [this one](https://advcash.gi/en/solutions/) offers virtual credit card and/or physical credit card to their account holders (who can be anonymous), but is only offered in Europe. These can be a method to use Bitcoin for daily things like buying food or paying for lodging.

Note that some services may decline these "Bitcoin" credit cards, because they are not issued by typical financial institutions. In that case, you will need to find ATMs that will take the credit card to offer cash.

## Buy Bitcoin either physically, or use a Bitcoin exchange

**Note:** Bitcoin is not fully anonymous (it is "pseudo-anonymous" only).

Bitcoin is not designed to be anonymous, as it is possible to trace the point of origin. If the family member who is sending BTC does so by wiring funds (USD) to an exchange, and buys BTC from those funds, and proceeds to sending that BTC over to the activist abroad, it is possible for a government to trace the transaction back to the exchange, and request the log files of that exchange to identify the person. While there are [ways](https://99bitcoins.com/buy-bitcoin/anonymously-without-id/) to obtain BTC anonymously using cash, the reality is that the CCP will likely not be able to demand log files for exchanges outside of its jurisdiction (i.e. those in five-eyes countries), so the risk of losing anonymity is reduced if your family members obtain BTC via US-based exchanges (for instance, [BitFlyer USA](https://bitflyer.com/en-us/)).

## Setup Bitcoin wallet

For small amounts (i.e. less than USD 10K worth of BTC), a software wallet will be enough. I recommend downloading [Electrum](https://electrum.org/), a very popular and reliable Bitcoin wallet application available for most computer platforms.

Instructions for setting up wallet:

- After loading the Electrum app, select "Create New Wallet"

- Type in the name of your wallet (keep the name vague and anonymous enough), and hit next. Select "Standard Wallet" and "Create a new seed"

- Select "Legacy" as the Seed type

- Electrum will output a list of words. These words are really important, and you must keep it secret, and write it down on a secure physical notebook (don't store in a computer). If your wallet is lost, this list of words will be used to recover your wallet.

- A list of words can look like: *“garbage kid exchange intact coffee legal mobile drill trash off deputy episode”*

- You will be asked to type in the list of words (for safety and to ensure you wrote it down correctly), and then you will create a password for the wallet (select Encrypt wallet file)

After following these steps, you will have created your wallet. To receive funds, click on:

- "Receive" (right next to "Send")

- Type in a safe Description (something like "transaction 1") and leave requested amount Empty

- Select "Expires after" 1 day

- Push "Select" button, and a 30-digit address on the right (looks something like "143T7okwoDRckGH2tDNWe6yLFmyqmCus5D") will have appeared in the Address box.

- Copy this address down, and communicate it with your family member (via secure chat like Signal). Your family will type in this address to send funds to your wallet. Later on, when you need to send funds, you will need to click on the "Send" button next to "Receive" and also enter an address to send funds out.

- When you send BTC, there is a small transaction cost (required to pay BTC miners), and a few options. Select the smallest charge, as it doesn't make really too much of a difference in speed.

After you setup your Bitcoin wallet, you will be able to receive and spend BTC using this wallet.

## Hardware Wallet

For better security, I recommend getting a hardware wallet. It will store your private key that links your ownership of bitcoin on a secure physical device, outside of your computer, so that it will never be exposed in the public network.

Get a wallet such as [Trezor One](https://shop.trezor.io/product/trezor-one-black). Sometimes they can be purchased cheaper on Amazon. You don't need to get the more expensive Trezor Model T, as the original Trezor One will do the job well.

The hardware wallet can use Trezor's web-based interface to send / receive, and even to purchase bitcoin. Alternatively, Electrum wallet can also use it as well. You can use both Trezor and Electrum simultaneously.
